  <p class="subtext">Common questions — answered with data and perspective.</p>

  <section class="faq-section">
    <details>
      <summary>Is this biased?</summary>
      <p>It uses outcome-based criteria — big games, longevity, and adaptability. It’s not “who dribbles better,” it’s “who wins more when it matters most.”</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is Messi still great?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. This just ranks Ronaldo higher under specific metrics like Champions League goals, trophy influence, and multi-league dominance.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why focus on big game performance?</summary>
      <p>Because high-stakes moments decide titles. Ronaldo has repeatedly delivered in knockout rounds, finals, and must-win matches.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What about assist numbers?</summary>
      <p>Messi has more career assists. This site weighs scoring impact and moments more than buildup play, though both matter.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Isn’t Messi more talented?</summary>
      <p>Talent is subjective — but the goal is to measure outcomes. This site prioritizes total output, adaptability, and decisive moments.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why value adaptability so much?</summary>
      <p>Because the best players produce anywhere, with anyone. Ronaldo’s success in England, Spain, and Italy supports his case for being system-independent.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Are you saying Messi isn’t clutch?</summary>
      <p>Not at all. Messi has clutch moments — but Ronaldo has more late-round goals, hat-tricks in knockout games, and last-minute turnarounds on the biggest stages.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is Ronaldo the greatest of all time?</summary>
      <p>That’s up for debate. But this site argues that under these criteria — impact, longevity, clutch performance — the case for Ronaldo is stronger.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I use this for a project?</summary>
      <p>Yes! Just cite sources responsibly and include your own critical points.</p>
